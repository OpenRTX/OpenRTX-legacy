# OpenDMR
## Open source firmware for the TYT MD380

This firmware is *highly experimental* and is not in a usable state right now,
however contributions and testing are welcome and accepted.

## Installation

To build and install the firmware, first clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/n1zzo/OpenDMR
```

To build the firmware you need to have a toolchain for the ARM ISA installed
on you system, you can install one using your package manager.
You can then proceed in building the firmware:

```
cd OpenDMR
make
```

If everithing compiled without errors you can connect your radio via USB,
put it in recovery mode (by powering it on with the PTT and the button
above it pressed), and flash the firmware:

```
make flash
```

Now you can power cycle your radio and enjoy the new breath of freedom!
