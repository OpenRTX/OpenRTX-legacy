OpenDMR was created by:

- Silvano Seva IU2KWO <silseva@fastwebnet.it>

All this was made possible by the huge reverse engineering effort of
Travis Goodspeed and all the contributors of [md380tools](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools).
A huge thank goes to Roger Clark, and his [OpenGD77](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/OpenGD77) which inspired this project,
and which we aspire becoming a part of.
